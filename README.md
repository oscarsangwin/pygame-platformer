# pygame-platformer
A python platformer project using the pygame module

A lot more coming soon, including levels, wall jumping, different types of obstacles and eventually networking to make the game multiplayer!

***NOTE: car(X)  <-- THE HIGHER THE NUMBER, THE LATER THE VERSION***

(the name is car as the project was first intended to be a car racing game)
